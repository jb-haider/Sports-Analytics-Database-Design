Employed Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) techniques to extract, transform, and load data into a database for a football team

Project Details:

In this data analytics project, we expertly employed Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) techniques to efficiently extract, transform, and load data into a meticulously designed database. This approach significantly bolstered the organization's data analysis capabilities.

Our project centered around the creation of an extensive database for a fictional football team, encompassing all team players. We diligently loaded this data into MS SQL Server, ensuring data integrity and consistency across various tables by constructing an ER diagram complete with primary and foreign keys using DDL.

A critical aspect of our project involved the formulation and execution of queries utilizing DML, effectively extracting pertinent data from the database to address pressing business challenges. To make the data more accessible and insightful, we harnessed Tableau to generate interactive dashboards. These dashboards provided a visual representation of the extracted data, allowing us to envision a practical scenario where this data-driven approach could significantly benefit football clubs in optimizing their team's performance through insightful data analysis.

In summary, our project harnessed DDL and DML techniques along with SQL and Tableau to build a comprehensive database and interactive visualization tools, offering a data-centric solution that holds the potential to revolutionize football team management. This approach provides clubs with the means to make informed decisions and enhance their team's performance, ushering in a new era of data-driven sports management.
